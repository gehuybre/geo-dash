# Kivy Gameplay Testing Notes

## Current Status
- âœ… App launches successfully
- âœ… Patterns load (10 medium difficulty patterns)
- âœ… No startup crashes
- ðŸ§ª Gameplay needs testing

## Test Checklist

### Visual Rendering
- [ ] Player character visible at correct position
- [ ] Obstacles appear and scroll left
- [ ] Ground/sky rendered properly
- [ ] Score displays in UI
- [ ] Game over screen appears

### Player Physics
- [ ] Player starts at correct Y position (250px from bottom)
- [ ] Gravity pulls player down correctly
- [ ] Jump power works (tap/click to jump)
- [ ] Double jump works
- [ ] Player lands on ground correctly

### Obstacles
- [ ] Obstacles generate from patterns
- [ ] Obstacles scroll left at correct speed
- [ ] Obstacle heights/widths match patterns
- [ ] Gaps between obstacles are correct
- [ ] Floating platforms (y_offset > 0) positioned correctly

### Collision Detection
- [ ] Player dies when hitting obstacle sides
- [ ] Player can land on top of obstacles
- [ ] Killzone obstacles trigger game over
- [ ] Collision detection accurate

### Score System
- [ ] Distance-based score increments
- [ ] Landing bonuses work
- [ ] Combo streaks tracked
- [ ] High score saves

### Touch Controls
- [ ] Tap anywhere to jump works
- [ ] Jump button visible and functional
- [ ] No lag in response

## Known Coordinate System Issues

### Pygame vs Kivy Y-Axis:
- **Pygame**: Y=0 at top, Y increases downward
- **Kivy**: Y=0 at bottom, Y increases upward

### Current Settings:
- `shared_config.py`: GROUND_Y = 650 (Pygame coords, for pattern manager)
- `kivy_game/config.py`: GROUND_Y = 250 (Kivy coords, 900 - 650)

### Potential Issues:
1. **Obstacle Y positioning**: Obstacles might be upside-down or off-screen
2. **Gravity direction**: Should be negative in Kivy (pulling down = decreasing Y)
3. **Collision rectangles**: May need Y-axis inversion

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Run the Kivy game
.venv/bin/python main.py

# Run the Pygame version for comparison
.venv/bin/python game/geo_dash.py
```

## Debug Output to Check

When running, look for:
- Pattern loading messages (should see 10 patterns)
- Obstacle generation happening
- Score updates
- Any error messages about coordinates

## Next Steps After Testing

1. If player/obstacles not visible â†’ Fix Y-coordinate conversion
2. If gravity wrong direction â†’ Invert gravity sign in player.update()
3. If collisions wrong â†’ Fix collision rect calculations
4. If everything works â†’ Add visual effects and polish!
